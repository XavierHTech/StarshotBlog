We are the young
Voices in unison, the ending has begun
A new kingdom come
Enter into this new Elysium

This new Elysium
This new Elysium

Born of the earth, are we all condemned to hell?
We've tried so hard but we can't save us from ourselves
Destined to die from the moment of our birth
So why have we forgotten everything that we are worth?

So why have we forgotten everything that we are worth?

We are the young, the chosen ones
Voices in unison, the ending has begun
A new kingdom come, a new will be done
Enter into this new Elysium

Looking for hope but it's often hard to see
It's obvious the future isn't what it used to be
We're born of the dust and to dust we will return
So why have we forgotten everything that we have learned?

So why have we forgotten everything that we have learned?

We are the young, the chosen ones
Voices in unison, the ending has begun
A new kingdom come, a new will be done
Enter into this new Elysium

The ending has begun

For me, for you
Enter into this new Elysium

Sometimes we need reminders of everything that we are worth

Rise up from the ground, join our voices to the sound
The time has come, new Elysium, tear this oppressive empire down

No more dreams are lost in time
No more lives are lost inside
New kingdom come, new will be done
Our voices unified

We are the young, the chosen ones
Voices in unison, the ending has begun
A new kingdom come, a new will be done
Enter into this new Elysium

For me, for you
Enter into this new Elysium
For me, for you
Enter into this new Elysium
For me, for you
Enter into this new Elysium
For me, for you
Enter into this new Elysium
