  <h2>Core of the Game</h2><br>
  At its core, <ss>Starshot</ss> is a game about <f>telling stories.</f><br>
  Stories that come through choices made in hard and mundane situations, the story of hard-fought battles, and the stories of those following and subservient to the player.<br><br>
  And what kind of stories are those?<br>
  Well... that's for the player to choose. Literally.<br><br>
  <h3>The Story</h3><br>
  A story is made of events both big and small, and all have the potential to cascade into larger <f>arcs</f>, whether by how it interacts with other events, or simply by its own tale continuing.<br>
  For <ss>Starshot</ss>, this is a principle of its design.<br>
  While not all events will have a continuation, many will- And the ramifications of even small events can be pivotal in the larger plots-<br>
  <h3>Choices Matter</h3><br>
  Maybe that scientist you rescued provides key intel for a grand battle, your crew may become increasingly rebellious as you ignore their matters, however trivial, and losing even one ship in a battle can drastically change how the story reacts.<br>
  <f>But choices in the game aren't the only ones that matter</f>- the process starts before a run is even started, as the player has the freedom to customise their story, by choosing their primary arc, starting fleet, and even the personality of who they take the role of.<br>
  <h3>The Fleet</h3><br>
  A fleet isn't complete without ships, a crew, and a leader, all three are provided to the player as they start, but the player will have to seek out a source for more, if they so seek them.<br>
  <f>And the fleet is life</f>
  The fleet is everything the player needs to progress- and they only have the one, no matter how much they bolster its numbers. If the player loses it, they lose their only way to proceed, though how they end up if they lose it is a matter of circumstance.<br>

  <h2>Story</h2>
  While the story of <ss>Starshot</ss> changes with each run, there are a number of common threads:<br>
  The area the player travels through is a lawless region, uncontested by any of the galactic governments for anything but the most exploratory measures.<br>
  The only law is that of the strongest around, be it for or against the player. Betrayals and treachery are frequent, but so is the opportunity to make riches- in one sense or another.<br>
  <br>
  While the player explores the world, they will likely find many things found outside of the scope of the game- a greater universe, written by primarily by Xavier.
  <h3>Memory and Impact</h3><br>
  Thanks largely to prior design choices, <ss>Starshot</ss> will be capable of remembering every last choice a player made in a given run, in ways that can lead to severe or powerful outcomes, both in the long and short term.<br>
  The game won't be the only thing to remember them, though- present in the planned <f>Codex</f>, the player will be able to find a <f>chronological record of their story and the choices made</f>, alongside a variety of lore entries to allow the curious to explore the world at large.<br>
  <h3>Arcs</h3><br>
  Like many larger stories, <f>arcs</f> will play a major role into how the world and characters evolve alongside the greater story... here more literally than most.<br>
  In <ss>Starshot</ss>, arcs are the embodiment of chapters and seasons within a run. Each one will have a major impact on the primary storyline, with significant shifts in power for both the protagonists and antagonists- be it unique ships, equipment, or even <f>recurring characters making themselves present</f>.<br>
  <h3>Story Packs</h3><br>
  Though a large part of this is present in the game's planned support for modification, the design of major and minor stories within <ss>Starshot</ss> allow for entire story packs to be written and deployed in an entirely self-contained manner- with the only additional work needed to ensure the content can be accessed in other stories, or vice versa, if that is so desired.<br>

  <br><br>
  <h2>Strategy</h2><br>
  <h3>Battlefield Flow</h3><br>
  The flow of the battlefield is very typical for the genre; The player moves their "pawns" in whatever manner they like- constrained by the limited actions they have each turn, and their opponent follows up with the same.<br>
  The battlefield itself is a hexagonal grid set in deep space- though not deep enough to keep it from often including debris, environmental hazards, or even gargantuan space installations.<br>
  <h3>Ships, In-Depth</h3><br>
  Ships are the player's "pawns" on the battlefield, each providing a means of fighting or otherwise supporting the fight, but it is always valuable to remember this:<br>
  <f>Ships are not created equally, even when they come from up high.</f><br>
  Ships can be broken down into a number of categories, each of which have bearing on the ship's primary usage and statistics. Even these categories can be categorised- but the most important classifications for a ship are <f>specialisation</f> and <f>hull class</f><br>
  <h4>Specialisation</h4>
  Analogous to classes from RPGs and other strategy games, the <f>specialisation</f> of a ship determines what role it plays in a fight, alongside its hull class, and in particular determines what kind of equipment a ship can have.<br>
  Some examples of specialisations included in <ss>Starshot</ss> are the ECM, Battleship, and Carrier specialisations, focusing on debuffing and disabling enemy targets, pure cannon power, and remotely participating in the fight, respectively.
  <h4>Hull Class</h4>
  Though it is perhaps more noticeable than a ship's specialisation, a ship's hull class is equally important in dictating how it is best used.<br>
  Hull classes determine the size, hull strength, and speed of a ship- alongside secondary effects- and thus far there are two primary hull classes; The small and nimble <f>frigate</f>, offering speed and a size of a single tile in exchange for a much weaker ship, and the bulky <f>cruiser</f>, offering a much more imposing and threatening presence, at the cost of being slower and harder to miss.<br>
  These are not the only classes, but most fit under these umbrellas, with one notable exception being the <f>parasite craft</f>. Parasite crafts are the ships deployed by carriers, and while not ships in and of themselves, they offer a similar variety of uses, provided the player can find and store them.<br>
  <h3>Ship Reactor</h3><br>
  Though a reactor detonation would be the most costly part of losing a ship in battle- an event that would render the wreck completely unsalvagable, the reactor is still important choosing how to utilise the ship in the first place.<br>
  As opposed to having a fixed and small number of actions per unit, per turn, each ship has a larger "energy" pool granted at the start of the turn, which all actions draw from. Many small actions- such as movement itself- can be performed at once, or a smaller number of more draining actions can be done, with neither excluding the other in the process.<br>
  In practice, this both allows for greater freedom in choosing how to act, and allows for finer moves to be made. For example, while a long-range destroyer may take almost all of its power to fire its main cannon, it would still be able to make small adjustments to its position before and after.<br>
  <h3>Abilities and Equipment</h3><br>
  Each ship has space for a range of modules to be equipped on it, each of which can drastically impact its behaviours in and out of battle.<br>
  As mentioned previously, a ships abilities and equipment are limited by its specialisation and hull class. Though this may be rather self-explanatory, this can have a deeper effect than one might think- even shields, armour additions, and the main guns can be limited or otherwise impacted by the design of the ship.<br>
  Though this list is neither comprehensive or final, some impacts of this may include battleships providing buffs to its armour and cannons, ECM ships getting stronger energy damage resistances from its shields, or a frigate being negatively affected by modules built for a larger hull class.<br>
  <h3>The Environment</h3><br>
  If a battlefield was the same as another, it wouldn't be as interesting- unless there was another reason for it.<br>
  A battlefield is going to be more than free and open space, though sometimes that may still happen. Objectives and hazards will appear frequently, be it asteroids, bases, or wrecks, to name a few things.
  Even the backdrops will change- nearby worlds, unique stars, occasionally a spectacle of its own may appear, far beyond the scope of combat.<br>

  <h2>Other</h2><br>
  <h3>Modding</h3><br>
  Though implementing such is foreign territory for Xavier, modding is intended to be a large aspect of the game's lifespan. Ex datatables as its "primary" datatables, so adding new tables would itself be reasonably simple.<br>
  Primarily, modding support will require either a dedicated mod manager tool or built-in plugins, both as a result of how Unreal Engine 4 handles mods. Despite this, a number of key game elements- namely, ships and story and choice data- are already fairly capable of supporting modding, provided a means of integrating new datatables is implemented.<br>
  <h3>Progression</h3><br>
  Metagame progression is a staple of the roguelike genre, and <ss>Starshot</ss> is not an exception to this. By completing runs, the player will be able to access new official content if they complete certain objectives.<br>
  One such piece of content is an entirely unique fleet set and storyline, that will be hidden among other official content.<br>
